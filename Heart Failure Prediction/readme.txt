#### Project introduction:
▪ The number one cause of death globally is Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). It is estimated that CVDs take 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths
worldwide.
▪ Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.
▪ Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioral risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol
using population-wide strategies.
▪ People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia or
already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

We are required to model the mortality (called as Death Event in this dataset) from the available independent variables. It can be used to understand how mortality vary with the
given independent variables. They can accordingly study the strategies of awareness and other research methodology in reducing the occurrence of such even.
